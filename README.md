An engineering giant was facing issues with its inventory management for its spare parts. Spare parts were frequently out of stock resulting in long waiting time for its customers. It wanted to be able to predict parts which could go out of stock in the future so that the waiting time for customers could be reduced. Historical data of spare parts orders was provided for over 65,000 orders.
